This is where you will add code to load all the countries and not just countries. Below is a single
instance of the class `CountryReader` that loads countries. There are 6 other continents to load or
maybe you create your own country file, which would be great. But try to implement a class that 
organizes your ability to access a countries polygon data.

I place local methods either here, or in the module we created. I'm leaving it here to help
with the lecture we had in class, but it can easily be moved then imported. In fact you should
move it if you have other "spatial" methods that it can be packaged with in the module folder.
