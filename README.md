A full stack solution for finding arches in the Midwestern State University campus architecture using machine learning. 


Created in 1922 as Wichita Falls Junior College, Midwestern State University built its first real building 
in 1937 on a 40-acre campus where it currently resides. The first building, which contained the entire college for a time was the Hardin Building, an impressive Spanish colonial structure which was presided over by a lofty bell tower. The architecture of course incorporates arches in every facet of the building. I am not an architect, but when you research "Spanish Colonial" the term arch is not prevelant. The key aspects are red tile (clay) roofs and stucco walls. The roofs exist on campus, but stucco is not. Further research shows there was a Spanish Colonial Revival Style (aka Spanish Eclectic style) that was prevalent from around 1915 - 1940. This style does include "rounded arches" but is not prevalent as it is on MSU's campus[^1]. Here is an image taken from [1] showing a style which I find similar to what many of the buildings on campus portray.
